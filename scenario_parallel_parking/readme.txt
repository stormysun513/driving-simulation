This subfolder includes the parallel parking stateflow model. Ideally, it 
is supposed to be constructed using concurrent process model to separate
decision and control unit as well, but now this feature is pending.

One can simulate parallel parking by running the simulation script. A
figure window will pop up and play the simulation result. 

One can replay the simulation result by running the replay script, which
use the variables in the workspace and relay result of last simulation
